# Explaining, Evaluating and Enhancing Neural Networks' Learned Representations

### Overview
This repository contains the code implementation 
for the submission *Explaining, Evaluating and Enhancing Neural Networks' Learned Representations*. 
We use [PyTorch Lightening](https://github.com/PyTorchLightning/pytorch-lightning) for 
training the models in our experiments.

This repository is organised as follows:
* `scores/` contains the implementation for our score and our implementation for computing the gradient-based attributions.
* `dataset_drift.py` is a script for running and reproducing the experiments described in Section 4.4.
* `train_constrs.py` is a script for running and reproducing the experiments described in Section 4.5.
